<p><strong>Background Image Link</strong> - When enabled in <strong>Settings</strong>, the <code>[ + ]</code> icon
is normally linked to a page containing more information about the displayed background. By providing a link here,
you can redirect the user elsewhere. This option accepts shortcodes (i.e., <code>[gallery_url 1]</code>) that
convert to URLs.</p>

<p><strong>Override by Category/Tag</strong> - By selecting existing categories or tags, you can specifically use
<em>this</em> Image Set instead of the default Image Set defined in <strong>Settings</strong>. Optionally, you can
also select a different background color and overlay than the one specified in <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>"
